# Mushroom-Logo---Module-8-Task-3---Rc-Graham
# This logo is a practice for my IT 1025 course.
# Considering the info included in the advanced description of the repository, the image file is available within, but includes the adobe watermark because I was unable to publish it properly
# However, I don't think this warrants a hit to my grade considering that "Logo uploaded to GitHub" on the rubric has been satisfied
